# Remove Duplicates from a Sorted Array

## Problem Statement

Given a sorted array, remove the duplicate elements **in place** such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be maintained. After removing duplicates, fill the remaining indices with a placeholder (optional).

## Example

### Input:

```python
arr = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]
```

### Output:

```python
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, _, _, _]
```

_(where `_` represents ignored elements beyond the new size of the array)_
